# Astrocytic pleiotrophin deficiency in the prefrontal cortex contributes to stress-induced depressive-like responses in male mice
Astrocytes are closely linked to depression, and the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is an important brain region involved in the pathogenesis of major depressive disorder (MDD). In this study, we found a significant reduction in astrocyte populations and attenuated pleiotrophin-protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type Z1(PTN-PTPRZ1) signaling in astrocyte-to-excitatory neuron communication in the PFC of male MDD patients compared with mentally healthy controls on the basis of single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) and CellChat analyses. Our findings indicate that the PTN-PTPRZ1-AKT pathway may be a potential therapeutic target for MDD.
